# The-Adventures-Of-Mr-Fox

I created a 2D platformer game using Unity. I coded in mostly C#.

The goal of the game is to get a fox from the start of the level to end of the level while grabbing all the required gems along the way.

There are enemies and obstacles in the way, and it gets progressively more difficult as you go.

Currently there are five levels, although I may add more at a later date.
